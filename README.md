This is a simple Minecraft shader I wrote for Optifine 1.19.2, although it should work on most versions.

**Features Include:**

 * CRT Overlay with Tweakable Settings
 * PSX/PS1 Effects
   * Polygon Jitter
   * Texture Warping
   * Adjustable Colour Depth
   * Dithering
 * Adjustable Screen Resolution
 * Classic Minecraft Lighting Emulator (Primitive)
